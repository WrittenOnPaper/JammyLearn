# JammyLearn

A java project I made for my school's science fair. (I got 4th place in the computer science catagory.)

It's a very very basic scratch clone that only lets you use code to move only 1 object and you are forced into only 1 tutorial. It takes about 3-6 minutes to see everything it has to offer.

If you want to run just the jar file itself, I have included jammylearn.jar.
